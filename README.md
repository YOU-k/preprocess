# Benchmarking UMI-based single cell RNA-sequencing preprocessing workflows

## Scripts for reproducing a broader methods comparison

The [scripts_summary](https://github.com/YOU-k/preprocess/tree/master/scripts_summary) folder contains scripts that include how we apply the preprocessing workflows in folder [preprocess](https://github.com/YOU-k/preprocess/tree/master/scripts_summary/preprocess), and how we implement the downstream analysis in folder [downstream](https://github.com/YOU-k/preprocess/tree/master/scripts_summary/downstream). These scripts can reproduce the analysis and figures from our paper: [Benchmarking UMI-based single cell RNA-sequencing preprocessing workflows](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-021-02552-3). 

## Results of comparisons

Some results not included in the manuscript and supplementary file are included in folder [plots](https://github.com/YOU-k/preprocess/tree/master/plots).
