# Benchmarking UMI-based single cell RNA-sequencing preprocessing workflows

## Scripts for reproducing a broader methods comparison

The [scripts_summary] folder contains scripts that include how we apply the preprocessing workflows in folder [preprocess], and how we implement the downstream analysis in folder [downstream]. These scripts can reproduce the analysis and figures from our preprint: [Benchmarking UMI-based single cell RNA-sequencing preprocessing workflows](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.17.448895v1). 

## Results of comparisons

Some results not included in the manuscript and supplementary file are included in folder [plots].
