,Advantage,Limitation
Cell Ranger,Good scalibility; Reliable performance based on clustering results. ,"Slow speed, and more memory usage; limited to 10X Chromium."
salmon alevin,High speed.,More cells detected using emptyDrops on tissue data (issue on cells with low gene content); Fewer reads assigned to pseudogenes; More biological noise in pseudogenes.
alevin fry ,Fastest speed; Reliable performance based on clustering results.,"Fewer reads assigned to pseudogenes; More biological noise in pseudogenes, and lowly expressed genes."
dropSeqPipe,,Fewer reads assigned to pseudogenes; Slow speed.
scPipe,"Capable to multi-platforms; Implemented in R, takes flexibility of the R environment.",More reads assigned to pseudogenes; More biological noise in lowly expressed genes on lung tissue and PBMC datasets. 
zUMIs,Capable to multi-platforms; including intron counts; High sensitivy; Interactive user interface (shiny app).,Run slowly with 10xv3 datasets at barcode binning step; Relatively lower correlations of raw count compared to other workflows; More biological noise in lowly expressed genes on cell line datasets. 
Optimus,Interactive user interface (Terra cloud).,"Running datasets containing more than 1500 cells need to increase cloud resource quotas, and takes more than 2 days to get a result."
kallito bustools,Fastest speed.,CB-UMI pair assigning issue (v0.39.3); Fewer reads assigned to pseudogenes; More genes yielding lower count; More biological noise in lowly expressed genes on lung tissue data.
scruff,"Reliable performance on RNAmix dataset based on clustering results; Implemented in R, takes flexibility of the R environment.",Slow speed.
celseq2,Higher sensitivity; Reliable performance on RNAmix dataset based on clustering results.,
